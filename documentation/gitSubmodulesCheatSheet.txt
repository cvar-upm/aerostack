HOW TO CHANGE A SUBMODULE AND UPLOAD THE CHANGES TO ITS INDIVIDUAL REPO
if you have changed the submodule ".stack/subm" in the stack "./stack". and the change is definitive.
-Submodules have HEAD detached. That means, they are not in any branch, they are just a commit.
-When you change them, the changes are not uploaded to the stack repo, but neither to its repo.
-The stack repo just point to the commit of the submodule.
1. Update submodule:
	1.1 go to the submodule "cd stack/subm"
	1.2 create a temporal repo and make the it point to it: "git branch temp" and "git checkout temp" (equivalent to "git checkout -b temp")
	1.3 add changes to the "temp" branch: "git add ." and "git commit -m "changes added""
	1.4 compare the "temp" branch with the "master" branch to check that all changes are correct
		git log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit master origin/master temp
		git diff master temp
		git diff origin/master temp
	1.5 if correct, update master "git branch -f master temp" and checkout in master "git checkout master" (equivalent to "git checkout -B master temp")
	1.6 delete "temp" branch "git branch -d temp"
	1.7 push changes to remote repo "git push origin master"

2. Update the stack repo
	2.1 go to the stack "cd stack". if you "git status -u" you can see "new commits" in the subm.
	2.2 "git add ." and "git commit -m "updated submodule" "
	2.3 "git push origin master"
